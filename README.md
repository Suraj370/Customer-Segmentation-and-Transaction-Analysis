## Project Overview

This project aims to transform transaction data into actionable business insights through customer segmentation and behavior analysis.

### Importance
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to:
- Tailor marketing strategies
- Improve customer retention
- Increase overall profitability

**Dataset**

The dataset has been taken from UCI Online Retail

# Customer Segmentation and Transaction Analysis: Part 1



## Methodology: K-Means Clustering

In this initial phase, we'll employ K-Means clustering to group customers based on their total spending.

### Benefits
- Identify distinct customer segments
- Understand purchasing patterns
- Enable targeted marketing campaigns
- Create personalized offers

## Data Preprocessing Challenge

Our starting point is invoice-level data, which requires transformation into customer-centric data.

### Process
- Convert transaction-based rows to customer-based rows
- Aggregate purchase details for each customer

## Context in Modern Business

- This type of analysis is often integrated into business intelligence software
- Many companies are incorporating these techniques into their platforms
- Some are exploring machine learning applications to refine the process

## Project Goals

By completing this analysis, we aim to:
1. Identify key customer segments
2. Provide actionable insights for business decision-making
3. Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty

This project engages with current methodologies in data-driven business strategy, contributing to the evolving landscape of customer analytics.

# Customer Segmentation and Transaction Analysis: Part 2

## Introduction to DBSCAN Clustering

In this second phase of our project, we'll leverage DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify customer clusters and outliers based on spending patterns and purchase intervals.

### Key Features of DBSCAN

- Handles clusters of varying shapes and sizes
- Effectively identifies outliers
- Automatically determines the number of clusters based on data density

### Advantages over K-Means

Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN doesn't require pre-specifying the number of clusters. This allows for the discovery of natural groupings within the data.

## Objectives

By applying DBSCAN to our customer data, we aim to:

1. Uncover organic customer segments
2. Identify customers with unusual purchasing patterns
3. Gain insights into the density and distribution of customer behaviors

## Potential Insights

This analysis may reveal:

- High-value customer segments
- Customers at risk of churn
- Opportunities for personalized marketing strategies

The DBSCAN results will complement our earlier K-Means analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and potentially uncovering new business opportunities.
